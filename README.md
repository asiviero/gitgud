# gitgud ![gitgud badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/gitgud%3F-good-brightgreen)

When things go wrong, you need to `gitgud`. `gitgud` acts just like `git`, but gives you superpowers when trying to `git push`. It will attempt to `git push` until it succeeds.

## `gitgud` is the new `git`

gitgud supports the same commands as `git` as it is effectively calling `git` under the hood.

## How to install

```console
gem install gitgud
```
